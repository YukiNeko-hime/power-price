A simple script to estimate the power bill for the month.

It reads two input files chart.csv and report.csv. The first one contains the power prices exported from sahko.tk, the second one has the power usage data exported from Vattenfall Oma Energia.

The script outputs a single png-file showing the usage and price graphs as well as the monthly totals.

Sample data and output is included.
